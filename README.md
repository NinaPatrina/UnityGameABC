# UnityGameABC
Capstone project for Ada Academy

In this project I integrate graphics, and write c# scripts to create a mobile game.  

It is an educational game around a crocodile who runs along the river to capture leters to learn sounds, also he likes to choose and wear cute looking hats.
To move around the game you can swipe left or right or use the mouse. To jump you can swipe up or use mouse.
The charachter can only run within river boundaries. 
The world is bended around the charachter. 

The following technologies were used:
